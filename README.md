hello-world 
My first trial learning repository created on 3/14/2014
it is my first file that i have created to teach me more about github and how to use git
I have learnt how to create a repository so far and it is called hello-world
new changes and new code
hi humans how are you ?
I like node.js, php and coffee script (it is what am made of!!!)
I love tacos on the moon and find them more superior to earth tacos.I love bread too.
 I have made this hello world repository grow into a project now with php code that implements secure login I have used this code to create a web project and test how sites are hacked or how I can secure my code.
 
I have removed some files to simplify the code. The repository is for storing code that interest me in general.
I have also found various ways of using github using this repository. 
I have added some content to the files.
